Achievable Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO) for this Multi-AZ, multi-region database in terms of:

 * Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage
 * Minimum RTO for a single region outage
 * Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage
 * Minimum RPO for a single region outage

RTO is defined as the targeted duration of time within which business processes are restored after disaster of disruption. For example 1h RTO would be reasonable for the following example:
 - 00:00 problem happens
 - 00:05 alarms are triggered - (5 mins)
 - 00:06 alert triggers staff - (1 min)
 - 00:16 on-call staff get to computer, log in, log onto VPN (10 mins)
 - 00:26 - On-call staff starts diagnosing issue (10 minutes)
 - 00:41 - Root cause is discovered (15 minutes)
 - 00:46 - Remediation started (5 minutes)
 - 00:56 - Remediation completed (10 minutes)
Total time: 56 minutes

RPO (Recovery Point Objective) is defined as the maximum amount of time over which data can be lost. For example, RPO is 20 minutes for the following example:
 - 07:00 database outage, the application is still running, but its losing data
 - 07:20 application stops running
 - 08:00 database is restored and the application is running

Database solution contains:
 - main database (udacity) consisting of active and stand-by instances.
 - read replica database (udacity-read-replica) composed of active and stand-by instances.

Main and read replica databases are in different regions us-east1 and us-west1. Within each region active and standby instances are deployed on separate availability zones (us-east-1a, us-east-1b) and (us-west-1a, us-west-1c).

RTO and RPO estimates for highly available, multi availability zones and multi-region database:
 * Minimum RTO 0 minutes for a single AZ outage
 * Minimum RTO 0 minutes for a single region outage
 * Minimum RPO 0 minutes for a single AZ outage
 * Minimum RPO 0 minutes for a single region outage
